Description: This function offers several options for creating plots with
    SpatialPolygons objects. This can be a single plot or multiple plots. These
    multi-plots can have the same legend or individual legends. Additionally, the
    layout call within this function offers many options for improving the resulting
    figures. A new function in this package, fillmap2, offers continuous shading via the viridis package.
